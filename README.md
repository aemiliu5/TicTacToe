# TicTacToe (command line)

Nothing special, just a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game played entirely through the command line, written in C.

Currently tested and working on Windows and Linux.

Compilation in Windows should be straightforward.
Compilation in Linux is done through the following command: `gcc -o ttt ttt.c -lncursesw`.
